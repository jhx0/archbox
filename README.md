What is it?  
archbox provides a Archlinux desktop in a container - simple and easy.  

To get started type the following into your shell (In the project root):  
$ make  
$ make run  

This will expose port vnc under the port 6002 and ssh on port 6001.  
(You can use your favorite VNC client to connect to the given port on your local system)
